Simple Neural Network in Python
===============================

This project was something I started and later used for both my AI and Machine Learning courses, with additions and alterations for each.
The program utilizes NumPy for computations, and PyPlot for a couple simple visualizations. The program demo uses sklearn's Digits dataset.

### File overview
  * Transform.py: a short script that prepares the Digits dataset for use in the neural network
  
  * NeuralNet.py: the neural network class
  
  * Demo.py: a script that demonstrates the neural network
  
  * digits.csv: the Digits dataset saved from sklearn
  
### Build instructions

First run `Transform.py` to transform the data into something more suitable, and run with `Demo.py`, which also contains hyperparameters to tinker with.
